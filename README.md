<p align="center">
   A modular environment for testing LangChain agents, tools, and chains. Demonstrates memory, prompt templates, and multi-tool workflows. Integrates OpenAI and local vector stores. Ideal for building early prototypes of autonomous agents. Codebase is clean, minimal, and extensible. Perfect for learning or deploying LangChain-based logic.
